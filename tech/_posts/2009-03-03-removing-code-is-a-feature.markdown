I saw a beautiful thing this evening in the <a href="http://blog.zenspider.com/2009/03/zentest-version-400-has-been-r.html">ZenTest 4.0.0 release notes</a> (emphasis mine):

<blockquote>2 minor enhancements:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deleted</strong> autotest/screen - releasing as a separate gem soon.</li>
  <li><strong>Deleted</strong> test-rails and rails<em>test</em>audit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Removing unnecessary code has always given me a <em>warm fuzzy</em> feeling.

In today's world of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">backups</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">version control</a> and <a href="http://maven.apache.org">dependency management</a> we need to learn to be <strong>ruthless</strong> with the delete key.

Don't comment it out. Don't talk yourself into thinking you'll use it later. <strong>Just delete it.</strong>

This is one of the same principals behind the <em><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/14/delete">inbox zero</a></em> concept and it is just as applicable to code. Nice work, <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">ZenTest</a>. We should get you a <a href="http://nerdmeritbadges.com/">merit badge</a>.
