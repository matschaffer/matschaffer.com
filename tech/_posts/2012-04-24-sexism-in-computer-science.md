[Trevor](http://trevmex.com/post/21644536045/a-paragraph-on-sexism-in-computer-science) encouraged me to write a paragraph on sexism in computer science and how we can change it. I encourage you to do the same!

Here's mine:

> [Angela Harms](http://angelaharms.com/) had a great quote on her recent
> appearance on the [Ruby
> Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/049-rr-agile-communication-with-angela-harms/)
> podcast. It's been ringing in my head all month: Stay present, stay
> vulnerable.

> I think it applies in a lot of situations and sexism in the work place is one
> of them. The news I've seen on the topic lately tends to be a situation that
> could have been avoided if people weren't trying to be cool or save face.
> We already build the most complex things that humans make. No need to act
> cool or demean your co-workers. We're all smart here. Stay present, stay
> vulnerable.
