title: My new X-Plat strategy
---
Thanks to a strong collaborative effort between myself and one of the members of <a href="http://twitter.com/mofro" rel="friend coworker">our front end team</a>. I'm pleased to announce my new cross-platform strategy for glyph management.

It's capable of operating under a variety of modes including that of a 6, 9 or lower-case 'e'. This new initiative will be the focus of my coming year.

(How's that, <a href="http://paradox1x.org" rel="friend coworker">Karl</a>?)
