title: Learning to Draw with Screencasts
---

I've been having so much fun with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/ "Inkscape. Draw Freely.") lately that I thought I should share. I basically got started with it when my wife and I ended up with no other option for our Christmas cards but to decorate our photos ourselves. Apparently most photo places don't do Christmas templates in a 4x6 format. So I downloaded Inkscape, bought a set of Christmas-styled stencils from [iStockPhoto.com](http://www.istockphoto.com/ "Stock Photography: Search Royalty Free Images & Photos") and we went to town.

Then she wanted sparkles. Sparkles... Our stencil set was sadly lacking sparkles. So I did what I always do when I need to learn something: I googled it. And found [this lovely tutorial](https://screencasters.heathenx.org/blog/2008/01/23/episode-050-sparkle-effect/ "screencasters.heathenx.org/blog  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; Episode 050 &#8211; Sparkle Effect") which showed me how to make a sparkle. It worked out great and the Christmas cards looked awesome. I enjoyed the process so much that I subscribed to heathenx's RSS feed of Inkscape screencasts.

If you're a coder interested in learning how to create some basic visual elements, I highly recommend checking out [screencasters.heathenx.org](http://screencasters.heathenx.org/ "screencasters.heathenx.org"). It's basically [RailsCasts](https://railscasts.com/ "Railscasts - Free Ruby on Rails Screencasts") for vector drawing. So far I've only watched the two screencasts, but I feel like I've learned a lot already. It also has a similar relaxation appeal to painting happy little trees.

Who knows maybe one day I can even make the jump [from engineering to design](https://www.arpitonline.com "arpitonline.com")...

or not.
