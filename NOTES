Post idea: 60s perf cheatsheet

uptime            -- load
dmesg | tail      -- systemic errors
vmstat 1          -- r (waiting for cpu), cpu usage, swap
mpstat -P ALL 1   -- cpu imbalance
pidstat 1         -- which pids are burning
iostat -xz 1      -- block io activity, %util
free -m           -- ensure some buffers & cache, zero would cause more disk i/o
sar -n DEV 1      -- check for traffic near link max
sar -n TCP,ETCP 1 -- check connections (active = out, passive = in) & retransmits
top               -- confirm activitiy from previous command
