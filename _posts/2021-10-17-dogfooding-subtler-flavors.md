Dogfooding.

[Wikipedia defines it as](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the practice of using one's own products or services.

It's often held up as a best practice in organizations. It makes great sense intuitively. If we're making the best product for our customers, _of course_ it should also be the best product for us when we have similar needs. What's more, we can learn about the shortcomings of our product through implementing it as a solution within our own company. When we have trouble, we can turn the pain points directly into feature plans and our customers might never have to experience the same difficulties.

It's win-win right?

Often it is, and there's a ton of value that can come from it. But it's important to recognize that it can also slow progress. Here's a few example scenarios I've seen play out where this can be the case.

## "It's on our roadmap"

## Cyclical dependencies, on the org level
