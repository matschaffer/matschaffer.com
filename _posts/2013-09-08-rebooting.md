So what happened last year?

## I taught Rails at UPenn

I taught a full year of CIS196 at UPenn. Being an adjunct teacher was _great_ and highly recommended to anyone interested. The skills I learned on presenting, course organization and mentoring keep coming in handy again and again.

## I took a full-time job at Netflix

This was a tough move but consulting just wasn't teaching me much about technology. I learned tons about business operations and project management. I'm sure I'll make good use of all this at some point but for now I really wanted to double down on my tech education. There were definitely a lot of takeaways from the business side, but I'll save those for later posts.

## I moved to San Jose

This was a prerequisite for the new job. But honestly it's like Hollywood for programmers out here and the weather is jaw-droppingly amazing.

Also working at Netflix has been perfect. I can't think of a better place to learn about high-scale software development.

## I rebooted this blog

The above points got me wanting to write again. One thing that I think we lost sight of at Mashion is how important writing is to a personal brand. The traffic on posts themselves is great but the writing process also helped me solidify a number of ideas both technical and non.

So here goes. I'm going to try to write a bit more regularly on some of my findings now that I'm back in the high-scale world in the heart of Silicon Valley. Wish me luck!
